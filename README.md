Install all dependencies with:
'npm i'

Make sure you acquire an API key from https://newsapi.org/
After acquiring the API key, create a .env file in the root directory and paste your API key after the REACT_APP_API_KEY=

example of what your .env file should look like:
REACT_APP_ACCESS_KEY=0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

run the app locally with 'npm run start'

this will create a local instance of the app on your machine

Please Note!

This app does not allow requests over https with the free account

You can only do requests from localhost
